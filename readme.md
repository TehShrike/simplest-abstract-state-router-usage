Want to use the abstract-state-router, and almost nothing else?  Here's the demo for you.

[See it here!](http://tehshrike.github.io/simplest-abstract-state-router-usage)

## Slightly more description

No package managers, no transpilers, no bundling.  Just script tags and an html file.

It's not how I'd make an app, but considering how confusing all the build options are, I'm definitely not gonna judge.

In addition to the [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), this demo uses [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org/) with the [ractive-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/ractive-state-router), though you can use whatever other templating library you like.
